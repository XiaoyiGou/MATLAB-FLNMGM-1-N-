Nonlinear mixed-frequency grey prediction model
With the advancement of data science, the demand for methods capable of simultaneously processing and utilizing complex mixed-frequency data systems with uncertainty characteristics is increasing. To address this need, a novel nonlinear mixed-frequency grey prediction model with two-stage lag parameter optimization is proposed which integrates frequency-domain analysis and optimization algorithm.
